# Oracle VM VirtualBox Learning

Welcome to my repository dedicated to exploring and mastering Oracle VM VirtualBox. This repository includes various documents, guides, and troubleshooting steps Iâ€™ve encountered while working with VirtualBox, particularly in a DevOps context.

# Enabling Clipboard Sharing

One of the features I found essential is enabling clipboard sharing between the Windows host and the Ubuntu guest. This functionality streamlines workflows by allowing quick transfer of text and files.

# Key Steps:
- Install VirtualBox Guest Additions on your Ubuntu VM.
- Mount the Guest Additions ISO and run the installer.
- Adjust the VirtualBox settings to enable bidirectional clipboard sharing.

For a detailed guide, refer to the [enabling-clipboard-sharing.md](./enabling-clipboard-sharing.md) file.

Feel free to explore other documents in this repository as I continue to learn and share insights about Oracle VM VirtualBox and its capabilities in a DevOps environment!
