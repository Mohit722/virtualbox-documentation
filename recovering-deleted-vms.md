# Recovering Deleted VMs

Accidental deletion of virtual machines can be distressing. This guide outlines steps to recover a deleted VM in Oracle VM VirtualBox.

# Steps to Recover a Deleted VM

1. Check for Backups:
   - Look for any backups of the VM. If you have created images or exported appliances, you can restore from those.

2. Import Appliance:
   - If you have an exported OVA or OVF file, go to `File` > `Import Appliance`.
   - Select the exported file and follow the prompts to import the VM.

3. Restoring Snapshots:
   - If snapshots were taken before deletion, check the snapshots section of your other VMs or the VM backups to restore the last saved state.

# Conclusion

Although recovery options depend on prior actions like backups or snapshots, these steps provide pathways to restore functionality and data.
